# Jossnet

**Jossnet** is a work-in-progress C library and demo project aiming to provide a simple and minimal base to build encrypted communications using the [Noise Protocol Framework](http://www.noiseprotocol.org).

This project focuses on clarity and simplicity, with a basic `server.c` and `client.c` setup to exchange structured messages (error codes, text, tokens, etc.) over a secure Noise-based handshake.
